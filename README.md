## Content

### Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

* [Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/nishant-ai/NLP-SentimentAnalysis/tree/master/Week%201): Learn to extract features from text into numerical vectors, then build a binary classifier for tweets using logistic regression.

* [Sentiment Analysis with Na√Øve Bayes](#): Learn the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities, then apply it toward building a Naive Bayes tweet classifier.
* [Vector Space Models](#): Vector space models capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. Learn how to create word vectors that capture dependencies between words, then visualize their relationships in two dimensions using PCA.
* [Machine Translation and Document Search](#): Learn to transform word vectors and assign them to subsets using locality sensitive hashing, in order to perform machine translation and document search.
